vnl5090 5pin for injector drivers and lsd
mic4469 for ignitor outputs
tl750m05 single regulator (confirm 500 mA is enough for everything)
 - or lm2931 dedicated regulator for adc -- 10 mA is really enough for just ADC
   and MAP sensors, only real output is TPS, which is very low current
   and lm2937 for main power

Only support:
4 dedicated injectors with vnl5090
4 dedicated lsds with vnl5090
4 dedicated ignition outputs with mic4469

expansion pin header to go to potential second board with at least:
4 more ignition
4 more injection
4 hsd
4 lsd
maybe some inputs?

power considerations:
tc4427 - 5 mA
maxx9926 - 10 mA
stm32f4 - 110 mA
can tranceiver = 70 mA
adc = <1 mA

output:
map sensor = 10 mA
